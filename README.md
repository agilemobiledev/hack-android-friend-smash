# Hack: Friend Smash sample Facebook app

Authors: Phil Hewinson

## What's a "Hack"?

We love talking to developers. Rather than talk over boring slides, we like diving straight into code and show devs how to build an app.

Most hacks are built for a specifically presentation and may not be updated afterward.  So it's important to note that THIS CODE WILL NOT BE MAINTAINED ANY MORE and could contain bugs. A new version will be provided after the Facebook for Android 3.0 SDK is launched and this version will be deprecated.

## Installing
